# INTRODUCTION
Machine learning processes new inputs based on patterns found over time, rather than explicitly programming them—that is, without having to manually write out instructions for a system to do something. To do this, machines must first be educated on prior data. Deep Learning teaches robots or computers to classify, recognise, and learn from experience in a manner comparable to that of the human brain. Massive data analysis has found success with deep learning. Deep learning can be used to train AI agents in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings. These days, it is used for many different purposes, such as image classification, object identification, segmentation, style transfer, colorization, reconstruction, super-resolution, and synthesis. Deep learning neural network techniques are displacing statistical techniques in the field of computer vision.


There are still a lot of challenging problems in computer vision that need to be solved. Deep learning techniques are nevertheless generating cutting-edge results for some specific problems. In a wide range of tasks and activities, including voice recognition in NLP, video analysis, and problems with image processing, computer vision, and self-driving car obstacle identification, CNNs are widely utilised.



CNNs are frequently employed in deep learning as a result of their significant contributions to these domains, which are rapidly growing and developing.A crucial characteristic of CNNs is their ability to achieve "spatial invariance," which refers to their capacity to identify and extract visual information from any position in the image. Because CNNs automatically extract features from photographs and other data, manual image extraction is not required. Therefore, CNNs are a valuable Deep Learning technique for producing precise findings. Although CNNs are most frequently employed for image analysis, they may be used for a wide variety of data analysis and classification applications. They can be used because they address crucial subjects including face recognition, video classification, identifying street/traffic signs, classifying galaxies, and interpreting and diagnosing/analyzing medical images, among others.
